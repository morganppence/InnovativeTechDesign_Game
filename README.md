Underwater Octopus Game

# About 
Here: I have utilized AI to help me create an interactive game. My game, Octopus Jump, combines the game flappy bird and the Google Chrome Dinosaur Gameâ€”also known as the "Chrome Dino". Users will use the space bar to make the octopus jump over hurdles with the game getting progressivly harder as a user plays. Once a user hits a barrier, the game ends.

# Reflection
This was interesting for me becuase after the resume assignment, I feel like I was starting to get the hang of Claude. Unfortunately, Claude didn't want to help me generate code and would just give me ideas of how to start coding. I pivoted to Chat and was able to start generating code that I liked. One obstacle I ran into was that the game would never end - even when the player would hit a barrier. After some back and forth, the game would reset. Chat also loved to make the game pretty impossible so I was able to ease up the game and I now think it's decently fun!
